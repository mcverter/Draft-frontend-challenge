# Draft-frontend-challenge

The code makes use of two external dependencies:
1. create-react-app provides the starter boilerplate
2. react-modal provides the modal template

All of the relevant code is in the client/src directory

To run this on your own machine:
*  cd client/
* npm install
* npm start
